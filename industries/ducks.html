        <h1>Ducks</h1>
        <p>From the Movie Dominion (2018)</p>
        <p> As with broiler chickens, macerators are still used in duck hatcheries for the weak or deformed ducklings who aren’t expected to survive the grow-out.

          Duck farming shares many similarities with broiler and turkey farming. Trucked from the hatchery on their first day of life, the ducklings are grown at an accelerated rate over just 7 weeks, housed with thousands of others in rarely-cleaned sheds where disease and fatalities are common.
          
          Ducks are aquatic animals, so they naturally have weak leg and thigh joints as they don’t normally need to hold their body weight for extended periods of time. Where surface water is available, ducks will float for long periods, reducing pressure on their muscular and skeletal system. However, when surface water is denied, as in most Australian farms including those labelled as free range, ducks must hold their entire body weight on their legs for up to 7 weeks – often much longer for ducks kept for breeding – resulting in lameness, dislocated joints and broken bones.
          
          Selective breeding aimed at growing ducks faster and heavier, coupled with the insufficient bone formation of their juvenile skeletal system, adds even more pressure on their already weak leg and thigh joints.
          
          Without water for even dipping their heads, ducks are unable to keep their eyes, nostrils and feathers clean, worsening the risk of disease or blindness. Living in their own waste and the resulting high levels of ammonia can cause painful burns on their feet and exacerbate wounds and injuries. These poor environmental conditions and overcrowding commonly lead to neurological disease where incoordination and head and neck tremors are followed by paralysis, convulsions, coma and death.
          
          When sick or injured ducks are found by workers, they are killed by having their necks broken.
          
          After 49 days, they’re collected into crates and forklifted onto trucks to be sent to the slaughterhouse.
          
          Many don’t survive the trip.
          
          Just like chickens and turkeys, ducks are hung by their feet onto the slaughter line.
          
          The typical electric stun bath, once again, is not always effective, with many birds having their throats cut open while conscious and eventually dying from blood loss or by drowning in the scalding tank.
          
          As of 2018, three states in Australia have banned the recreational shooting of wild ducks on cruelty grounds, but in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, the practice remains legal during an open season each year. 
          
          The population of waterbirds in Victoria has been steadily declining, in 2017 hitting the lowest numbers in 34 years, yet the hunt continues under justification of increased business to the rural communities surrounding the wetlands, and the general enjoyment and satisfaction felt by the hunters.
          
          Computer simulation estimates and the observations of rescuers on the wetlands indicate that duck shooters leave at least as many birds wounded and uncaptured as they kill and capture, amounting to many thousands of ducks left to suffer or die from untreated injuries.
          
          Additionally, the bodies of many legally protected species such as the rare and endangered Freckled Duck have been retrieved from the wetlands during hunting season, with shooters either failing to identify the species before firing, or just firing anyway.
          
          Around 80% of the world’s down and feathers used for items like jackets, sleeping bags and bedding come from China, where the live plucking of ducks and geese remains a common practice. This involves painfully ripping the feathers out of the birds’ skin, leaving open and bloody wounds, a process repeated multiple times before they are finally slaughtered. Even suppliers claiming certification under the Responsible Down Standard have been found engaging in live plucking. Ultimately, it isn’t possible to know whether particular down products in Australia or elsewhere come from these farms. </p>

        <h1>Sheep</h1>
        <p>From the Movie Dominion (2018)</p>
        <p>‘Winter lambing’ is the practice of impregnating sheep so that they give birth in winter months, meaning their lambs are weaned in spring when pastures are most fertile. While this allows the lambs to grow more quickly, it results in 10-15 million newborn lambs – roughly one in every four – dying within 48 hours of birth from exposure to the harsh cold. For sheep farmers, this is still preferable to the higher feed costs of lambing in warmer months. 

          To reduce soiling and the risk of flystrike for the lambs who make it to summer, their tails are docked or cut off entirely, and they are often mulesed at the same time, which involves cutting off the skin around their buttocks and the base of their tail with metal shears. If the lambs are younger than 6 months, it is legal to do this without any pain relief. The Merino breed, accounting for around 80% of the wool produced in Australia, have been selectively bred to have wrinkled skin resulting in excessive amounts of wool while making them much more prone to flystrike and therefore more commonly subjected to mulesing.

If the lambs are younger than 6 months, it is legal to do this without any pain relief.
          
          Sheep shearers are paid by the number of sheep shorn, not by the hour, so speed is prioritised over precision, and there is no requirement for formal training or accreditation.
          
          After a few years, when they can no longer produce enough wool to be considered profitable, the sheep are sent to slaughter and sold as mutton, while lambs raised for meat are killed between 4 and 12 months of age, far short of a natural lifespan of 12-14 years.
          
          19 million of the 32 million sheep killed each year in Australia go through saleyards, an intermediary between farms and slaughterhouses or private buyers, where animals also including cattle, calves, horses, poultry and pigs, are auctioned off.
          
          Heat stress, dehydration, exhaustion, or pre-existing conditions are common causes of deaths at saleyards.
          
          Most of the sheep are bought by slaughterhouses for their meat.
          
          No animal at a slaughterhouse walks willingly to their death.
          
          Again electrical stunning proves regularly ineffective, causing only pain and terrifying the animals even further in their final moments.
          
          Bolt gun stunning is no better.
          
          Regardless of how effective stunning may appear, it’s impossible to know with certainty whether an animal has been rendered completely unconscious and insensible to pain, or is merely paralysed and unable to move, while still feeling everything.
          
          In their fear and desperation, some manage to briefly escape, directly confronted with the bodies of those before them, before being forced back into the race, knowing they’ll be next.   </p>

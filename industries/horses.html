        <h1>Horses</h1>
        <p>From the Movie Dominion (2018)</p>
        <p>Horses are not skeletally mature until around 5 years of age, but commonly their racing careers begin when theyâ€™re only 2 due to the lure of higher prize money and a quicker return on investment. This drastically increases the risk of injuries, with up to 80% suffering from shin soreness, or dorsal metacarpal disease.

          Researchers at the University of Melbourne found that, following a race, 56% of horses have blood in their windpipe and 90% have blood deeper in their lungs. Another study found haemorrhaging in the lungs of 95% of horses checked during two post-race examinations, while another found stomach ulcers in 86%, increasing in prevalence and severity as training and racing progressed. Up to a third of young racehorses in training develop inflammation of the lower airway as a result of unnatural living conditions, confined to small stables for up to 22 hours a day where they are exposed to high levels of dust, allergens and endotoxins.
          
          Post-race examinations have found a high prevalence of blood in the horses' windpipes and lungs, along with an increasing frequency and severity of stomach ulcers as training and racing progressed.
          
          On the track, they are painfully whipped to encourage greater speeds. Race rules limit whipping in the earlier stages of the race, but in the last hundred metres when the horses are fatigued and less able to respond, there are no limits and they are often whipped relentlessly until the finish line.
          
          Jumps racing is statistically 19 times more dangerous than flat racing, with violent falls a regular occurrence. Roughly half of the horses involved in jumps races each year in Australia disappear, quietly exiting the industry in unknown circumstances, never to race or be heard from again, or killed on track, with green screens erected to obscure the view of racegoers.
          
          Nationally, 11-12,000 racing horses are newly registered each year, while roughly the same number leave the industry, largely as a result of poor performance, unsuitable temperaments or injuries. Many of these end up at knackeries, where they are killed for pet food or to feed racing greyhounds. 
          
          Others end up at one of two licensed horse abattoirs that export horsemeat for human consumption.
          
          Horses are also used in rodeos. </p>

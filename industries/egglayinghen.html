        <h1>Egg-Laying Hen</h1>
        <p>From the Movie Dominion (2018)</p>
        <p>For egg-laying hens, life begins at the hatchery.

          Eggs collected from the parent birds are stored, incubated and hatched over 31 days.
          
          The male and female chicks are sorted onto separate conveyor belts. Here at Australia’s largest hatchery, they’ve been genetically modified to make the males a different colour than the females, allowing for quick sorting.
          
          Unable to ever produce eggs themselves and a completely different breed to the chickens used for meat, the male chicks are considered waste products, as are any females perceived to be deformed or weak. They are sorted onto a separate conveyor belt from the healthy females in their first day of life, and sent into an industrial blender called a macerator. This practice is legal and referred to as humane by the RSPCA. Smaller hatcheries may use carbon dioxide gas or simply suffocate the chicks in plastic bags.
          
          All commercial egg farms – caged, barn laid, free range, organic, RSPCA-approved – involve the killing of male chicks, to a total of roughly 12 million per year in Australia.
          
          Meanwhile, the healthy females continue on to painful debeaking machines. Hens are debeaked to minimise the harm they can do to each other in the confinement of egg farms.
          
          The chicks are then stacked in trays and trucked to pullet rearing farms, where they’ll remain for 4 months until they begin laying eggs.
          
          A small number of males will be spared the macerator in order to serve with a selection of hens as parent birds, laying and fertilising the eggs for the hatchery.
          
          The other hens are sent out to egg farms across the country.
          
          Around two-thirds of the 18 million layer hens at any given time in Australia are housed in battery cages. Each shed can contain up to 100,000 hens, with between 4 and 20 per cage, each hen afforded a space smaller than a A4 sheet of paper.
          
          They are unable to stretch their wings or express any natural behaviours such as dust bathing, perching or foraging.
          
          Due to decades of genetic manipulation and selective breeding, they lay an egg almost every day for a total of up to 330 per year, compared to the 10-15 that a wild hen would lay.
          
          As they age, the poor environment and physical stress of frequent egg-laying takes a toll on their health, indicated by the gradual loss of all of their feathers and an increasingly pale comb suggesting anaemia.
          
          Deaths inside the cages are common, and due to the size of the facilities can be easily missed for long periods of time, forcing the surviving hens to live on top of the rotting carcasses.
          
          Newer cage systems collect the faeces onto conveyor belts beneath the cages, while older systems allow it to pile up underneath. Birds who manage to escape the cages are left to die in these manure pits.
          
          At 18 months of age, after living in the cage for over a year, their egg production will have slowed significantly enough to be considered “spent”. They are “depopulated” – pulled from the cages and stuffed into crates, often resulting in bone fractures due to rough handling. They are either gassed to death and then buried or rendered, or sent to the slaughterhouse, and replaced by new 4-month old hens.
          
          Up until 2016, there were no national standards on what can be claimed as free range eggs. Now, free range farms are capped at a maximum outdoor density of 10,000 hens per hectare – one per square metre – though they still spend most of their time packed together in large sheds.
          
          Chickens naturally form and live within a social hierarchy called a pecking order, but are only able to recognise around 100 other chickens. In sheds or paddocks with thousands of other birds, their inability to maintain this pecking order results in chaos. The weak birds are picked on with no way to escape. Disease spreads rapidly. An outbreak of avian influenza at a New South Wales free range egg farm in 2013, believed to be contracted from wild ducks, led to the culling of over 400,000 farmed hens.
          
          Many of the larger free range farms also have cage farms on the same property, with the eggs from both ending up in the same packing shed. A 2009 analysis of Egg Corporation data indicated that as many as one in six eggs sold as "free range" were laid by caged or barn hens.
          
          As with caged farms, free range hens are sent to slaughter from just 18 months of age, far short of their 10 year natural lifespan. At the slaughterhouse, the hens are shackled upside-down on a moving line. They are lowered into a bath of electrified water to stun them prior to their throats being cut by an automated blade, but if they lift their heads, they can miss the stun bath, facing the blade fully conscious and ultimately drowning in scalding water further down the process.
          
          The slaughtered hens largely end up in lower-grade chicken meat products such as mince, or rendered into poultry meal for use in pet food or to be fed back to farmed animals.  </p>

        <h1>Cows</h1>
        <p>From the Movie Dominion (2018)</p>
        <p> Like humans, cows are strongly maternal beings who form close bonds with their young, and must give birth in order to produce milk.           

          On dairy farms, they are forcefully impregnated every year to keep this milk flowing, usually by artificial insemination rather than natural mating, which requires workers to insert their arm into the cow’s anus to hold her cervix in place while injecting her with semen collected from a bull.
          
          Their calves are taken away mere hours after being born so that the milk intended for them can be collected and sold for human consumption.
          
          Over the days following separation, the mothers bellow day and night, searching for their calves. They’re known to grieve for days or even weeks.
          
          The male calves, called bobby calves, are considered useless to the dairy industry because they’ll never be able to produce milk. They are kept isolated for five days before being herded onto a truck, and sent either to a saleyard first, or direct to the slaughterhouse. They can be withheld food for the last 30 hours of their lives.
          
          Starved, confused and desperate for affection, they cry for their mothers from the holding pens of the slaughterhouse where they’ll be killed the following morning.
          
          Those who avoid the stunner or who are improperly stunned are killed while conscious.
          
          Around 700,000 male calves are slaughtered as waste products of the dairy industry every year in Australia alone.
          
          A small number of male calves are grown out for longer, up to 20 weeks, to be slaughtered for veal.
          
          The female calves are also kept isolated, fed on powdered milk replacer, eventually to join the cycle after being impregnated themselves.
          
          2-3 times per day, the lactating cows are herded into the milking shed and hooked up to industrial milking machines.
          
          In natural conditions, they can live up to 20 years. On dairy farms they last only 4 to 8 years, some – known as downers – succumbing to the pressure of continuous impregnation and producing up to 10 times more milk than they naturally would, the rest sent to slaughter when their milk production begins to slow down or they become too injured to continue.
          
          Artificial insemination is preferred to natural mating in the beef industry also,
          
          Calves raised for beef are subjected to a variety of painful surgical procedures without anaesthesia, including disbudding or dehorning…
          
          … ear tagging…
          
          … castration, either with a blade, or by a practice called ringing, where an elastic band is tightly clamped around the base of the testicles, restricting blood blow until eventually they rot and fall off.
          
          … and branding with a hot iron.
          
          Those who get sick typically lack veterinary care and deteriorate quickly.
          
          Drugs including antibiotics, growth hormones, vitamins and supplements, and progesterone for maintaining pregnancy are injected… or inserted vaginally… or orally.
          
          These and other regular routines like sorting or checking for pregnancy see the cattle forcefully herded through the yard system into a restraint box called a crush for individual attention. 
          
          Around 40% of Australia’s total beef supply and 80% of beef sold in major domestic supermarkets comes from cattle who have spent the last 10-15% of their lives packed into barren feedlots, where they are fattened up with grain before slaughter at 18 months of age.
          
          They’re forced into the knockbox, from which they will desperately try to escape.
          
          The captive bolt gun is the most common method of stunning cows, but the smaller guns especially are often ineffective against such large animals, causing only pain and limited mobility, but not unconsciousness. 
          
          A rifle is a less common alternative.
          
          After stunning, they are shackled by the leg and hung upside-down, their throats cut open. 
          
          In addition to witnessing the animals before them being stunned, killed and sometimes even the processing, in most cases they are also forced to hear their fate from the next room.
          
          For cows slaughtered while pregnant, the blood from their unborn calves, known as fetal calf serum or fetal bovine serum, is of great value to the pharmaceutical industry, fetching around $600 per litre.
          
          The hides of cows and bobby calves are sent to tanneries to be turned into leather, the majority of which is then exported overseas. There is a common misconception that leather is a by-product of the meat industry intended to reduce waste; it is far more accurate to say that it is a co-product, sometimes more economically valuable than meat to the point where more and more animals are being killed for their skin rather than for their flesh.
          
          Cheap leather for use in shoes, handbags and other accessories is also imported to Australia, the United States and Europe from developing countries like India and Bangladesh.
          
          As cows are considered sacred by the Hindu religion, their slaughter is illegal in 24 of India’s 29 states. To be legally slaughtered for leather, they must first be transported hundreds or thousands of kilometres to one of the five exempt states or across the border to Bangladesh.  
          
          Depending on the route and the number of animals – sometimes in the thousands – much of this transport can occur on foot. In preparation, many have shoes nailed into their feet and ropes threaded tightly through their noses.
          
          Exhausted, starving and thirsty, many collapse along the way, compelled to stand by having their nose ropes pulled or their tails broken… being beaten with sticks, or having chilli pepper rubbed into their eyes.
          
          For the rest of the journey, they are crowded into and out of trucks, their horns piercing and gouging each other and their bones often breaking. 
          
          Those who make it to the slaughterhouse are killed in front of each other without prior stunning, some even skinned alive.
          
          The hides are soaked in toxic chemicals known to cause cancer or chronic skin diseases, often by children.
          
          The fundamental concept of rodeos is the physical control and domination of weaker, more vulnerable beings. Calves, steers and bulls are physically provoked for the entertainment of spectators in some 240 rodeo events held across Australia every year.
          
          Normally quite docile animals, they endure tail twisting, electric prodding and other physical abuse behind the scenes, as well as the use of metal spurs and straps tightened around their abdomens, to make them “buck” and appear wild.
          
          With intensity and risk integral factors for an entertaining show, injuries are inevitable.
          
          Calf and steer roping involves the lassoing of terrified animals as they try to run away, violently jerking them to a halt, and commonly resulting in bruising, broken limbs, horns and even necks, ligament tearing, internal haemorrhaging and subcutaneous tissue damage.  </p>
